Changelog
=========

Next Version (YYYY-MM-DD)
-------------------------

-  Added a :ref:`FAQ item <faq_if_else>` that the plugin indents wrong in
   certain ``if else`` situations in various languages.

-  Added a :ref:`FAQ item <faq_reindent_fails>` that the command ``Reindent
   File`` fails in certain situations.


Version 0.7.3 (2019-11-10)
--------------------------

-  Fix how version numbers were retrieved. In the ``v0.7.2`` DLLs it still said v0.7.1.
   Now the version numbers are completely based upon the git repository.
   The version in the documentation still need to be updated manually,
   but that is probably not possible due to the automatic processing by Read The Docs.


Version 0.7.2 (2019-11-07)
--------------------------

-  Provide a 64-bit version of the plug-in.

-  Converted the documentation from DocBook to reStructuredText.
   The documentation is now hosted at `Read The Docs`_.

Version 0.7.1 (2013-04-17)
--------------------------

-  Frank Fesevur has taken over the maintenance of this plug-in.

-  Fixed: Reindent file is now one undo action.

-  Fixed: Disabled ``Reindent File`` for Python, see :ref:`the FAQ <faq_python>`
   for more details.

-  Restructured the source files to personal preference.

-  Solution files for VS2005 are provided as well.

-  Started to write documentation using DocBook. This is the first
   result. The current FAQ is based upon issues posted on `Ben's
   BitBucket`_ page. The revision history until version 0.7 was taken
   from the `forum post`_ about this plug-in.

Version 0.7 (2011-09-18)
------------------------

-  This release fixes issues with certain lexers that notify on the
   following line (Ruby, HTML, Lisp, Lua, Pascal, XML). For these lexers
   you need to have a line following the one you are typing on.

-  The following screencast shows it in use and how it works:

Version 0.6 (2011-06-19)
------------------------

-  This changes IndentByFold to more heavily rely on the
   SC\_MOD\_CHANGEFOLD notification from Scintilla.

   This means that when you end a fold (e.g. with a } ) it will unindent to
   the same level as the start of the fold.

-  One Bonus feature of this handles } else {, in that it will unindent at
   the }, and when you have else {, it will know that the fold has
   increased again, so will on the next line increase the indent.

   NOTE: This can only do it in one go (i.e. you can't go onto a line with
   }, and type in else {, and expect it to be indented on the next line, as
   it won't have known that it unindented for the }. I may be able to work
   around this at some point, so we shall see, but hopefully not too much
   of an issue.

-  Same goes for the Reindent file, because it doesn't actually have a
   logged decrement of the fold at } else {, it looks to the reindent code
   that it's remained at the same level ( so won't decrement the
   indentation for } else { )


Version 0.5 (2011-05-21)
------------------------

-  Idea behind this plug-in is rather simple, if the fold level increases
   or decreases, so should the indentation.

-  Using C-like languages as an example:

   Typing in { and pressing enter, will mean the line you are now on, has
   1 more level of indent than the {.

   Typing in } and pressing enter, will match the indentation of { line, so
   the } is now lined up properly.

-  There is also an option in the plug-in menu to reindent the file based
   on the fold levels.
